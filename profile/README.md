Hi there, let's modernize e-mail ðŸ‘‹
---

Self-hosting an e-mail server is notoriously difficult. While privacy is a top concern for many individuals and businesses, the complexities of self-hosting a mail server often outweigh the benefits, leading many to choose to sacrifice some privacy and pay a third-party provider to manage their email instead. One of the key challenges of self-hosting an email server is the outdated and complex nature of most available open-source mail server software. 

Mission ðŸš€
---

Stalwart Labs' mission is to help modernize, democratize and promote decentralization of email by 
creating an open-source mail server in Rust that is simple to run but at the same time extremely secure, 
robust and focused on privacy.
