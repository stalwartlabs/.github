Hi there, we want to modernize e-mail üëã
---

Self-hosting an e-mail server is notoriously difficult. Most of the open-source mail server software 
available was written decades ago and suffers from being slow, convoluted or too complicated to 
install and maintain. A quick search for the terms ‚Äúself-hosting email‚Äù on HackerNews or Reddit shows that most 
system administrators and enthusiasts truly value their privacy but they would rather sacrifice it 
and pay Google or Microsoft to host their email instead of having to deal with the complexities 
of running a self-hosted mail server. In addition to that, most popular mail servers have not yet fully 
implemented modern internet e-mail standards such as the JSON Meta Application Protocol
which is a much more efficient replacement of IMAP.

Mission üöÄ
---

Stalwart Labs' mission is to help modernize, democratize and promote decentralization of email by 
creating an open-source mail server in Rust that is simple to run but at the same time extremely secure, 
robust and focused on privacy.

Team
---

Stalwart Labs Ltd. is a very small team consisting of just [one developer](https://github.com/mdecimus), who has been implementing 
email software in C since the mid-90s. 

Sponsorship

All components and libraries released so far have been written without any external funding.
